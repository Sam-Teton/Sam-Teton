- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sam-Teton
- 💞️ I love using data to uncover the stories inside. 
- 💞️ After growing up on a dairy farm in PA and graduating from Penn State, I developed this passion through dairy consulting and learning the query run relational database management system VAS DC305 which provided access to seemingly unlimited analytic possibilities. 
- 🌱 In my short career I have had the opportunity to gain extensive experience in consulting, management, sales, and dairy genetics. Most notably I have been able to develop and use value added programs that helped businesses understand their management opportunities and increase profits by $100,000s.
- 🌱 I have an advanced skill level working with Excel and DC305, and am proficient with BigQuery (SQL), RStudio (R), Tableau, and Python. I am constantly improving my abilities and striving to learn other programming languages. 
- 👀 Currently I am looking for opportunities where I can utilize and improve my skills in data analytics by helping businesses unlock solutions that their data can provide.
